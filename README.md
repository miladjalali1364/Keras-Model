# **Develop your first Deep Learning Model in Python with Keras**
Keras is an open-source API used for solving a variety of modern machine learning and deep learning problems.<br>
  It enables the user to focus more on the logical aspect of deep learning rather than the brute coding aspects.<br>
  Keras is an extremely powerful API providing remarkable scalability, flexibility, and cognitive ease by reducing the userâ€™s workload.<br>
  It is written in Python and uses TensorFlow or Theano as its backend.
  
# **This Keras tutorial has a few requirements:**

    You have Python 2 or 3 installed and configured.
    You have SciPy (including NumPy) installed and configured.
    You have Keras and a backend (Theano or TensorFlow) installed and configured.

# **Brief Overview of Neural Network**

  Neural Network consists of a larger set of neurons, which are termed units arranged in layers. 
  In simple words, Neural Network is designed to perform a more complex task where Machine Learning algorithms do not find their use and fail to achieve the required performance.

Neural Networks are used to perform many complex tasks including Image Classification, Object Detection, Face Identification, Text Summarization, speech recognition, and the list is endless.
